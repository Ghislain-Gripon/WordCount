Shakespeare occupies a position unique in world literature.
Other poets, such as Homer and Dante, and novelists, such as Leo Tolstoy and Charles Dickens,
have transcended national barriers, but no writer’s living reputation can compare to that of Shakespeare,
whose plays, written in the late 16th and early 17th centuries for a small repertory theatre,
are now performed and read more often and in more countries than ever before. The prophecy of his great contemporary,
the poet and dramatist Ben Jonson, that Shakespeare “was not of an age, but for all time,” has been fulfilled.
